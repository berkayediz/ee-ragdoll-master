# Fivem Ragdoll Script

This Fivem script allows the player's character to fall into a ragdoll state when the "U" key is pressed. This script can be used as a standalone solution or integrated into the FiveM framework.
## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file.
2. Copy the files to the `[resources]` folder of your FiveM server.
3. Readname the file as `[eeragdoll]`
4. Add the following line to the `[resources]` section of your `server.cfg` file:
   ```
   ensure eeragdoll
   ```
5. Start your FiveM server or run your standalone installation.

## Usage
Once in-game, pressing the "U" key will make your character fall into a ragdoll state while continuing to control movement. The ragdoll duration is set to 1000 milliseconds (1 second), but you can modify this duration by editing the code.
